This project uses the GermanWordEmbeddings toolkit by Andreas Mueller (see https://github.com/devmount/GermanWordEmbeddings). Our slightly modified version of the toolkit can be found under src/test/GermanWordEmbeddings. It has its own license file in the directory mentioned above. Changes were made in the different preprocessing files and the evaluation script. The rest of the project is subject to the following license. Our preprocessing script at src/preprocess/preprocess.py is based on the preprocessing script in the GermanWordEmbeddings toolkit, as mentioned in the file itself.
