The main experiments were run on a private data set. To allow replicability, we performed additional experiments on a public data set found at http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html


Before executing any experiments, we must download and extract German News Crawl articles into 'data/raw/' by executing 'data/raw/downloadData.sh' from within that directory. Next, we preprocess the data using 'src/preprocess/preprocessAll.sh', removing stop words, converting umlauts etc.. Then we create ten random permutations of the corpora by running 'src/preprocess/preshuffle.sh' so we don't have to shuffle the data every time we run a crossvalidated experiment.

Experiments can be found in 'src/experiments/'. Any experiments should be started with working directory set to the root directory of this project. 

To run the experiments mentioned in the paper, run 'src/experiments/robustnessToPermutation.py' and 'src/experiments/robustnessToSubsampling.py' after performing the preparation steps mentioned above.
